# EkoCrate Form

A small popup created for the team at https://ekocrate.com

This form uses the following technologies

* CSS
* HTML
* FIREBASE
* JAVASCRIPT

The idea is that the user would fill all the data, this data will be validated and then the user will be able to save it to a firestore collection.

## DEPLOY INSTRUCTIONS

* You need to include the contents of the index.html file in an HTML element in squarespace.
* The page containing the HTML element in squarespace should have a url like this:

```javascript
    /zipcheck?beds=studio
    /zipcheck?beds=34
    /zipcheck?beds=5
    /zipcheck?beds=12
```
(Notice the `?beds=` parameter, this is important for the site to know where to redirect the user)
